                Hey there! I'm Mike, and I'm passionate about helping people transform cluttered spaces into organized, functional areas that bring joy to everyday life.

                After 15 years of designing and building custom storage solutions, I've learned that good organization isn't just about buying containers - it's about creating systems that work with your lifestyle. Whether you're dealing with a chaotic garage, an overflowing closet, or a pantry that's lost its way, I can help you design and build practical storage solutions that last.

                I specialize in teaching DIYers how to plan, build, and install their own custom storage systems. From simple floating shelves to complete garage makeovers, I'll guide you through the entire process - measuring, designing, selecting materials, and building. And yes, I'll even help you tackle those tricky IKEA hacks!

                Let's create some order in your space together! üè†‚ú®

                Hello there! I'm Sue, and I've been blessed to work with clay for over 40 years now. 
                
                I keep my classes small and relaxed in my home studio, where I have all my wheels and kilns set up. Due to the nature of pottery equipment, I can only offer sessions here in my Buda studio - but I promise you'll feel right at home! Whether you've never touched clay before or you're looking to refine your techniques, I'd love to share what I've learned over the years.
                
                And don't worry about making mistakes - goodness knows I've made plenty! Those "happy accidents" often turn into our favorite pieces. üå∏

                Hey there, beer enthusiasts! üç∫

                I'm Lorraine, and I've been obsessed with crafting the perfect brew for over a decade. What started as a curious experiment in my garage has turned into an amazing journey of teaching others how to make incredible beer at home.

                Look, I get it - home brewing can seem intimidating at first. All those terms like "mashing," "specific gravity," and "hop schedules" might sound like a foreign language. But here's the thing: I was once in your shoes, and I've made pretty much every brewing mistake possible (ask me about my exploding bottle story sometime üòÖ).

                That's exactly why I love teaching! Whether you're just starting with extract brewing or ready to dive into all-grain, I'll break everything down into simple, manageable steps. No brewing question is too basic - seriously, I want to hear them all!

                Ready to start your brewing adventure? Let's make some awesome beer together! üåü
